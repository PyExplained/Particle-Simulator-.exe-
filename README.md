# Particle Simulator (.exe)
This version of the particle simulator is not recommended, but if you don't have Python installed and still want to try out the simulator, you can use this version. 
Please refer to the original repository for more details: https://github.com/PyExplained/Particle-Simulator.

<i> Note: the .exe file is quite large and slow to open!
